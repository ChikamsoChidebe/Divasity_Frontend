# Layout and Visual Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Layout Container Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Pages were cramped with insufficient height and spacing
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated main layout to use `min-h-screen` and proper padding
  - Increased top padding from `pt-16` to `pt-20` for desktop
  - Added bottom padding and margins for better spacing

### 2. Page Spacing Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Components were too close together
- **Solution**:
  - Increased margins between sections (mb-8 → mb-12)
  - Added more padding to cards and containers
  - Improved grid gaps (gap-4 → gap-6)

### 3. Background and Visual Appeal ✅
- **Problem**: Plain backgrounds and poor visual hierarchy
- **Solution**:
  - Added gradient backgrounds (`bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-50 to-gray-100`)
  - Improved card shadows and hover effects
  - Enhanced button and input styling

### 4. Content Container Width ✅
- **Problem**: Content was too narrow on larger screens
